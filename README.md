Master Your PvP Alertness: YellSapped is a specialized addon for World of Warcraft, exclusively optimized for PvP environments. Created using the AceAddon framework, it is engineered to alert you and your teammates the moment you're incapacitated by a "Sap" — a stealth attack predominantly used by Rogues.

Key Features:

Automatic Alerts: Automatically sends a predefined message in the chat to alert your team when you're sapped. This immediate notification can crucially prompt quick assistance, significantly impacting the outcome in PvP battles.

Customizable Messages: Choose from a variety of messages such as "I've been SAPPED!!" or "Rogue is here!" to quickly communicate your status to teammates. Select your preferred message from the addon's options panel for tailored communications.

Adaptive Message Channels: Configure the output channel for your alerts—whether it's Yell, Say, Party, Raid, Guild, or Officer chat. Customize how you communicate based on your tactical needs in PvP scenarios.

PvP-Optimized Triggering: Utilizes combat log entries to detect Sap effects specifically in PvP scenarios, ensuring the addon remains efficient and focused without unnecessary alerts during non-PvP activities.

Easy Configuration: Accessible via the Blizzard interface options, YellSapped provides a straightforward configuration menu where you can set your message preferences, choose alert channels, and preview your message settings.

Installation and Usage:

Install YellSapped through your preferred addon manager or manually by placing it into your WoW AddOns folder.
Fine-tune your settings through the game's Interface options menu to align with your PvP strategy and preferences.
Step into PvP with heightened awareness, equipped with YellSapped to ensure that whenever stealth tactics take you by surprise, your team is immediately informed, facilitating swift counteractions and strategic coherence. This addon is a must-have for any serious PvP participant aiming to enhance their responsiveness and teamwork in the heat of battle.
